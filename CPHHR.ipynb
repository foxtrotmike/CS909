        "(Fayyaz Minhas)\n",
        "\n",
        "In survival analysis, the *hazard ratio* quantifies how the hazard (i.e., the instantaneous event rate) changes with a one-unit increase in a covariate. For example, a hazard ratio of 1.5 for age means that for each additional unit (say, 1 year), the hazard increases by 50%.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "❗ **Important Warning:**  \n",
        "Hazard ratios are *scale-dependent*. Changing the unit (e.g., measuring age in years, decades, or centuries) will change the numeric value of the hazard ratio — even though the underlying model and its predictions remain exactly the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "🚫 **Therefore: You should never compare models based on the magnitude of their hazard ratios.**  \n",
        "Saying *\"my hazard ratio is higher than yours\"* makes no logical sense for evaluating model performance.  \n",
        "It's not a scoring metric — it's a parameter estimate that reflects the scale of the covariate.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "🎯 **Goal of this experiment:**  \n",
        "To illustrate that the same Cox model fitted to the same data will produce different hazard ratios depending only on how we scale the covariate — *not* because one model is better than another.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "🧠 **Machine learning researchers, take note:**  \n",
